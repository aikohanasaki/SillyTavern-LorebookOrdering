# üìö Lorebook Ordering (A SillyTavern Extension)

A SillyTavern extension that adds lorebook-level priority and budget management to World Info. Allows complete control over which lorebooks activate first and how much context budget each lorebook can consume. Perfect for users with multiple lorebooks who need fine-grained control over World Info behavior.

**üìã [Version History & Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)**

Settings are accessed via the "Lorebook Ordering" button in the World Info panel (appears next to the search box when lorebooks are available).

## üìã Prerequisites

- **SillyTavern:** 1.13.4+ (latest recommended)

- **Multiple Lorebooks:** Extension is most useful when you have multiple lorebooks that need prioritization

## üí° Recommended Global World Info/Lorebook Activation Settings
Tested with these settings:

- **Insertion Strategy:** "evenly" (required for STLO to work)
- **Max Recursion Steps:** 2 (general recommendation)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install & Configure**
- Install the extension in your SillyTavern extensions folder
- Ensure you have multiple lorebooks available
- Set World Info insertion strategy to "evenly" in SillyTavern settings

### 2. **Access Settings**
- Open the World Info panel in SillyTavern
- Look for the "Lorebook Ordering" button next to the search box
- Click to open the lorebook management modal

### 3. **Configure Priorities**
- Select a lorebook from the dropdown
- Set priority level (1=Lowest to 5=Highest, 3=Default)
- Configure budget settings if needed
- Save and repeat for other lorebooks

---

## üéØ Priority Levels

### **Priority System**
- **Highest (5):** Lorebook entries activate first and get priority in budget allocation
- **High (4):** Higher than default priority
- **Default (3):** Standard SillyTavern behavior (unchanged from original)
- **Low (2):** Lower than default priority
- **Lowest (1):** Lorebook entries activate last

### **How It Works**
- Higher priority lorebooks are processed first during World Info activation
- Entries from higher priority lorebooks get preference in context budget allocation
- Only works with "evenly" insertion strategy

---

## üí∞ Budget Management

### **Budget Modes**

1. **Default:** Uses SillyTavern's standard budget allocation (no override)
2. **Percentage of Context:** Allocate a specific percentage of total context window
3. **Percentage of Budget:** Allocate a specific percentage of World Info budget
4. **Fixed Tokens:** Set an exact token limit for the lorebook

### **Budget Examples**
- **Percentage of Context (20%):** If context is 8000 tokens, lorebook gets 1600 tokens
- **Percentage of Budget (50%):** If WI budget is 2000 tokens, lorebook gets 1000 tokens
- **Fixed Tokens (500):** Lorebook gets exactly 500 tokens regardless of other settings

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

### **Per-Lorebook Settings**
- **Priority:** 1-5 scale with descriptive labels
- **Budget Mode:** Choose from four allocation strategies
- **Budget Value:** Numerical value for percentage or fixed modes
- **Auto-save:** Settings are automatically saved when changed

### **Global Behavior**
- **Strategy Validation:** Automatically detects if "evenly" strategy is required
- **Smart Warnings:** Only shows compatibility warnings during actual generation (not on chat load)
- **Generation Tracking:** Distinguishes between automatic greetings and user-initiated generation

---

## üö® Compatibility & Warnings

### **Strategy Requirements**
STLO requires the "evenly" World Info insertion strategy to function. When the extension detects:
- Special lorebook settings are configured
- Strategy is NOT set to "evenly"

You'll see a warning popup with options to:
- **Stop Generation:** Halt generation to fix settings first
- **Disable STLO:** Continue without lorebook ordering

### **Best Practices**
- Always use "evenly" strategy when STLO is active
- Configure budget percentages that don't exceed 100% total
- Test priority settings with a small conversation first

---

## üîß Advanced Usage

### **Multi-Lorebook Scenarios**
- **Character + World:** Set character lorebook to High/Highest priority
- **Memories/LTM:** Set memories to lowest priority and set a specific budget for memories.
- **Budget Control:** Prevent any single lorebook from dominating context
