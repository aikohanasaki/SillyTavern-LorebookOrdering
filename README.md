# üìö Lorebook Ordering (A SillyTavern Extension)

A SillyTavern extension that adds lorebook-level priority and budget management to World Info.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **SillyTavern:** 1.13.4+ (latest recommended)
- **World Info Strategy:** MUST use "evenly" insertion strategy for STLO to function
- **Multiple Lorebooks:** Extension is most useful when you have multiple lorebooks that need prioritization

## üí° Recommended Global World Info/Lorebook Activation Settings
Tested with these settings:

- **Insertion Strategy:** "evenly" (required for STLO to work)
- **Max Recursion Steps:** 2 (general recommendation)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install & Configure**
- Install the extension in your SillyTavern extensions folder
- Ensure you have multiple lorebooks available
- Set World Info insertion strategy to "evenly" in SillyTavern settings

### 2. **Access Settings**
- Open the World Info panel in SillyTavern
- Look for the "Lorebook Ordering" button next to the search box
- Click to open the lorebook management modal

### 3. **Configure Priorities**
- Select a lorebook from the dropdown
- Set priority level (1=Lowest to 5=Highest, 3=Default)
- Configure budget settings if needed
- Save and repeat for other lorebooks

---

## üéØ Priority Levels

### **Priority System**
- **Highest (5):** Lorebook entries activate first and get priority in budget allocation
- **High (4):** Higher than default priority
- **Default (3):** Standard SillyTavern behavior (unchanged from original)
- **Low (2):** Lower than default priority
- **Lowest (1):** Lorebook entries activate last

### **How It Works**
- Higher priority lorebooks are processed first during World Info activation
- Entries from higher priority lorebooks get preference in context budget allocation
- Only works with "evenly" insertion strategy

## üé≠ Group Chat Character Overrides (NEW!)

### **Per-Character Customization**
In group chats, different characters can now have different lorebook behaviors during their individual turns:

- **Character-Specific Priorities:** Alice might use a lorebook at Priority 5, while Bob uses the same lorebook at Priority 2
- **Individual Budget Overrides:** Each character can have custom budget allocation for the same lorebook
- **Seamless Integration:** Works automatically during group chat generation - no additional setup required

### **How Group Chat Overrides Work**
1. **Configure Override:** In the lorebook settings, expand "Group Chat Overrides" section
2. **Select Characters:** Choose which characters get special settings for this lorebook
3. **Set Custom Values:** Each character can have unique priority and budget settings
4. **Automatic Application:** During group chat, when it's Alice's turn, she uses her override settings; when it's Bob's turn, he uses his

### **Example Scenarios**
- **Character-Focused Lorebook:** Set character's personal lorebook to Priority 5 for them, Priority 1 for others
- **Lore Specialization:** Scholar character gets high priority on academic lorebooks, warrior gets low priority
- **Budget Management:** Verbose character gets larger budget allocation, quiet character gets smaller allocation

### **Important Notes**
- **Single Chat Behavior:** Character overrides are ignored in single-character chats (uses default lorebook settings)
- **Fallback Logic:** Characters without specific overrides use the lorebook's default settings
- **No Conflicts:** Switching from group to single chat automatically clears override state

## üí∞ Budget Management

### **Budget Modes**

1. **Default:** Uses SillyTavern's standard budget allocation (no override)
2. **Percentage of Context:** Allocate a specific percentage of total context window
3. **Percentage of Budget:** Allocate a specific percentage of World Info budget
4. **Fixed Tokens:** Set an exact token limit for the lorebook

### **Budget Examples**
- **Percentage of Context (20%):** If context is 8000 tokens, lorebook gets 1600 tokens
- **Percentage of Budget (50%):** If WI budget is 2000 tokens, lorebook gets 1000 tokens
- **Fixed Tokens (500):** Lorebook gets exactly 500 tokens regardless of other settings

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

### **Per-Lorebook Settings**
- **Priority:** 1-5 scale with descriptive labels
- **Budget Mode:** Choose from four allocation strategies
- **Budget Value:** Numerical value for percentage or fixed modes
- **Auto-save:** Settings are automatically saved when changed

### **Global Behavior**
- **Strategy Validation:** Automatically detects if "evenly" strategy is required
- **Smart Warnings:** Only shows compatibility warnings during actual generation (not on chat load)
- **Generation Tracking:** Distinguishes between automatic greetings and user-initiated generation

---

## üö® Compatibility & Warnings

### **Strategy Requirements**
STLO requires the "evenly" World Info insertion strategy to function. When the extension detects:
- Special lorebook settings are configured
- Strategy is NOT set to "evenly"

You'll see a warning popup with options to:
- **Stop Generation:** Halt generation to fix settings first
- **Disable STLO:** Continue without lorebook ordering

### **Best Practices**
- Always use "evenly" strategy when STLO is active
- Configure budget percentages that don't exceed 100% total
- Test priority settings with a small conversation first

---

## üîß Advanced Usage

### **Multi-Lorebook Scenarios**
- **Character + World:** Set character lorebook to High/Highest priority
- **Memories/LTM:** Set memories to lowest priority and set a specific budget for memories
- **Budget Control:** Prevent any single lorebook from dominating context

### **Group Chat Advanced Strategies**
- **Character Specialization:** Give each character high priority on their relevant lorebooks
  - Scholar: High priority on "Magic Theory" lorebook, Normal priority on "Combat Tactics"
  - Warrior: High priority on "Combat Tactics" lorebook, Low priority on "Magic Theory"
- **Dynamic Budget Allocation:** Adjust token limits based on character verbosity
  - Chatty character: 800 token budget on dialogue lorebooks
  - Quiet character: 400 token budget on same lorebooks
- **Lore Consistency:** Ensure character-specific information only appears during their turns
  - Character backstory lorebooks set to Priority 5 for that character, Priority 1 for others
